# uni-math
(I dunno how one writes markdown) (and I don't know how to use english)
So this is a totally unstructured sum of all Documents I need for my math studies.
I don't really know if this is legal, as there are some documents only available for enrolled students...
So my idea behind the stucter was
- math
    - ana
        - ana I
            - script
            - exercise sheets
        - (ana II)
        - ...
    - lina
        - lina I
            - script
            - exercise sheets
        - ...

- computer science
    - concepts of computer science (Konzepte der Informatik)
        - lecture slides (probably not okay to make accessible)
        - excercise sheets (probably not that okay too)
    - programming course
        - nothing important
    - rsn (Rechnersysteme und -netze)
        - ...

- physics
        - IK
            - IK I
                - script (it's weird don't be surprised)
                - exercise sheets

and don't look into the .tex or .cls files I'm afraid that they are very ugly
